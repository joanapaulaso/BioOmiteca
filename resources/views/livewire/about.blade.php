            <strong>BioOmiteca Atlantic Forest</strong> is a digital platform for the integration of metabolomic and biogeographic data on species from the Atlantic Forest. But what does that mean? ü§î
        </p>
        <p class="mt-12">
            The integration of these types of data has a very simple and, at the same time, essential purpose:
            With metabolomics, we spread knowledge about the bioeconomic potential that species from the Mata
            Atlantic have. With the biogeographic modeling, we analyzed the areas of suitability of the species
            within a specific geographic area. The integration of these data, therefore, offers the opportunity
            to know the species present in the rich biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest through the characterization
            of the molecules with biotechnological potential that they produce, as well as whether the current network of Units of
            Conservation is effective in protecting these species. On the other hand, areas of suitability of species
            represent places with the potential to carry out sustainable cultivation.

        <p class="mt-12 font-mono text-lg font-semibold">
            Our premise is to introduce a new paradigm in the natural products sector: the diffusion of knowledge
            on the bioeconomic potential of Atlantic Forest species should be done together with the dissemination of
            essential information for its conservation and sustainable use.

        <p class="mt-12">
            The target audience is the widest possible: general public, farmers, members of traditional communities,
            public authorities linked to the environmental sector, among others.
